<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Xiaoyan Cong(‰∏õÁÆ´Ë®Ä). I am a senior undergraduate student at Chu Kochen Honors College & College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, majoring in Robotics Engineering and minoring in Mathematics and "AI+X" Program. During my undergraduate, I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou](http://xzhou.me/) at [State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/index.html) and [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/) at [Visual Intelligence Lab, HKUST](). I also spent a lovely summer at The University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/).

My research interest lies in the field of 3D & 2D Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Robotics, particularly including 3D reconstruction, scene understanding, generative model as well as expanding robots' physical interaction capabilities.

I'm looking for PhD position starting in Fall 2024, you can find my [CV](https://github.com/xy-cong/xy-cong.github.io/raw/main/docs/CV.pdf) here. Feel free to contact me if you have any leads!

# üíª Research Experience
- *2023.06 - present* **Research Intern, The University of Texas at Austin**

   Advisor: [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/).
   I'm exploring an implicit representation for deformable objects reconstruction from a monocular RGB-D camera. **One submission(first author)** is expected to be coming soon. Look forward to it!

- *2023.03 - present* **Research Intern, Visual Intelligence Lab, HKUST**

   Advisor: [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/).
   Guided by [Prof. Chenyang Lei](https://chenyanglei.github.io/), I‚Äôm exploring a novel *diffusion-based* approach for automatic image colorization given black-and-white images by imitating the imagination process of human experts. **One submission(first author)** is expected to be coming soon. Look forward to it!

- *2022.10 - present* **Undergradute Research Intern, CAD&CG, ZJU**

   Advisor: [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou](http://xzhou.me/).
   Guided by [Sida Peng](https://pengsida.net/) and [Bojian Wu](https://bojianwu.github.io/), I am exploring how to accurately reconstruct the geometry and generate high-quality novel view images of refractive and reflective objects(e.g. transparent objects) by making use of neural implicit 3D representations and differentiable rendering.

- *2022.02 - 2022.06*  **Deep Scientific Research Training Program, Chu Kochen Honors College, ZJU**  

   Advisor: [Prof. Rong Xiong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rong-Xiong). 
   I have finished the Deep Scientific Research Training Program of Chu Kochen Honors College on ‚ÄúDetection and Tracking of Millimeter Wave Radar‚Äù, which is awarded as excellent ( 10 in total ). The project focused on exploring how to combine vision sensors(RGB camera) and millimeter-wave radars to increase the accuracy of object detection. 

- *2022.06 - 2023.01*  **Student Research Training Project, ZJU**      
   Advisor: [Prof. Wei Jiang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/jiangwei). 
   I am participating in a Student Research Training Program(SRTP) on ‚ÄúCross-domain performance evaluation method of pedestrian re-identification model based on model parameter distribution‚Äù, focusing on exploring the relationship between data domain(original & target) and model parameters, realizing online evaluation of model performance, and laying a foundation for the further online model update.
