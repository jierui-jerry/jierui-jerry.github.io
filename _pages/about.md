My name is Xiaoyan Cong(‰∏õÁÆ´Ë®Ä). I am now an undergraduate student at Chu Kochen Honors College & College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, majoring in Robotics Engineering. Currently I am supervised by [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou](http://xzhou.me/) at [State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/index.html). My research interests lie in the field of 3D&2D Computer Vision and Robotics, particularly including 3D reconstruction, scene understanding, as well as expanding robots' physical interaction capabilities.

I'm looking for PhD position at 2024fall, you can find my [CV](https://github.com/xy-cong/xy-cong.github.io/raw/main/docs/CV.pdf) here.
