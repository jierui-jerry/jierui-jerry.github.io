Hi! I'm Xiaoyan Cong(‰∏õÁÆ´Ë®Ä), a senior undergraduate student (Sep. 2020 - ) at [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/_t1906/wbout/list.psp) & [College of Control Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/cseenglish/main.htm), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), majoring in Robotics Engineering and minoring in Mathematics and ‚ÄúAI+X‚Äù Program. During my undergraduate, I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou](https://www.xzhou.me/), [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/), and [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/). 

My research interest lies in the intersection of 3D Computer Vision and
Computer Graphics, particularly including neural rendering, reconstruction, and generative AI, as well as their applications in robotics.

I'm looking for PhD position starting in Fall 2024, you can find my [CV](https://github.com/xy-cong/xy-cong.github.io/raw/main/docs/CV.pdf) here. Feel free to contact me if you have any leads!

   Advisor: [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/) and [Prof. Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io/).
   I'm exploring an implicit representation for deformable objects reconstruction from a monocular RGB-D camera. **One submission(first author)** is expected to be coming soon. Look forward to it!

- *2023.03 - present* **Research Intern, Visual Intelligence Lab, HKUST**

   Advisor: [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/).
   Guided by [Prof. Chenyang Lei](https://chenyanglei.github.io/), I‚Äôm exploring a novel *diffusion-based* approach for automatic image colorization given black-and-white images by imitating the imagination process of human experts. **One submission(first author)** is expected to be coming soon. Look forward to it!

- *2022.10 - present* **Undergradute Research Intern, CAD&CG, ZJU**

   Advisor: [Prof. Xiaowei Zhou](http://xzhou.me/).
   Guided by [Sida Peng](https://pengsida.net/) and [Bojian Wu](https://bojianwu.github.io/), I am exploring how to accurately reconstruct the geometry and generate high-quality novel view images of refractive and reflective objects(e.g. transparent objects) by making use of neural implicit 3D representations and differentiable rendering.
